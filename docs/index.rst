PyKED is a Python package that provides the reference implementation of the interface to ChemKED
files. PyKED reads ChemKED files, validates their structure and content, and allows the user to
interact with the data contained in the ChemKED file. PyKED is licensed under the permissive,
open-source BSD 3-clause license. The source code is publicly available on GitHub at
https://github.com/pr-omethe-us/PyKED.

This is the documentation for the |release| version of PyKED. The documentation
for the unreleased, developers' version of PyKED is available at
https://pr-omethe-us.github.io/PyKED/devel, and documentation for old releases
is available on the `Releases page <https://pr-omethe-us.github.io/PyKED/releases.html>`__.
The stable version of the documentation is always available at https://pr-omethe-us.github.io/PyKED/
